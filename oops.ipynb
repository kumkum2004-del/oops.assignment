        "\n",
        "#ques.2 What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is like a blueprint or template used to create objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#ques.3 What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class is the blueprint, and an object is the real thing made using that blueprint.it is an realisation of the class.\n",

        "#ques. 4 What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction\n",
        "    - Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the important features.\n",
        "  -  Encapsulation\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# ques. 5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __add__, etc.\n",

        "\n",
        "# ques. 6 Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPs.\n",
        "  - inheritance is the concept of inheriting the features,variable and functions of  a base class into derived class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ques. 7  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism means ‚Äúmany forms.In OOP, it allows one function, method, or operator to behave differently depending on the object calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ques. 8  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation means hiding the internal data of an object and controlling access to it.In Python, we achieve this using:\n",

        "\n",
        "# ques. 13 What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "   - The @property decorator in Python is used to make a method act like an attribute.\n",

        "     - Use getter, setter, and deleter functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# ques. 14  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism means ‚Äúmany forms.You can write a single function that works with different types of objects, saving you from writing similar code again and again.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
